				<h2>Dyatlov Pass - A terrifying, yet intriguing case</h2>
			</center>
			<hr />
			<h3>Information about the case:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Total victims: 9.</li>
				<li>Cause of death: 6 from hypothermia, 3 from physical trauma.</li>
				<li>Location: Ural Mountains, Russia.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Other details:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The tent they were temporarily staying in was ripped open from the inside.</li>
				<li>One body emitted radiation.</li>
				<li>Some of the eyes and tongues had been eaten.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Theories:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Yeti; Some believe a Yeti was responsible, but that wouldn't explain the radiation. Does explain physical trauma.</li>
				<li>Aliens; Somewhat-likely, explains radiation and physical trauma.</li>
				<li>Government secret; Some think they stumbled upon something they shouldn't have seen, KGB got to them. Explains trauma, maybe radiation.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>My Theory:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Due to the lack of breathable air, the man must've hallucinated something or someone chasing him.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is my only theory for this one, and I find it to be the most plausible. Contact me on Instagram (@peculiar.jc) if you have any other theories.</p>
